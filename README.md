# speech-translator
In this task we are planning to make a Foreign language speech recognition software for converting a foreign language speech to English text. Far from a being a fad, the overwhelming success of speech-enabled products like Amazon Alexa has proven that some degree of speech support will be an essential aspect of household tech for the foreseeable future. If you think about it, the reasons why are pretty obvious. Our fundamental objective is to take input in a foreign language, for example, French or Mandarin(Chinese) or German and then create a software which performs complex level of speech recognition of the spoken language and then displays it as plain text. It shall convert the given text to English and gives the output in text format.The purpose of this project is to implement a translating service which can help people to communicate with one another if they are unable to speak the other personâ€™s language and vice-versa.
